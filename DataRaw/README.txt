1. The data set(StudentPerformance) contains [Number of Rows: 1000 Number of Columns: 9]

2. The idea is to analyze the data by using visualizations I,e what are the factors that are affecting student performance
	a. gender 
	b. race/ethnicity
	c. parental level of education
	d. lunch 
	e. test preparation course

3. Before data visualization, data pre-processing is very important.

4. Preprocessing steps done:
	a. Check for null values
	b. Renaming the column names for better data manuplation
	c. Creating the average of maths, writing and reading to improve the process speed

5. visualization results:
	a. With the help of subplot we can clearly state that 'male' is good at maths, where as in reading, writing female dominates male
	
	b. With the help of boxplot we can say that there is slight variation in avg and group E has highest average on comparing with other groups

	c. With the help of barplot we can say Masters degree has better avg score compare with other 

	d. With the help of stripplot It is clear that standard feature has better average score

	e. With the help of swarmplot and boxplot  we can clearly say that test_prep completed has better average score
